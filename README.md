## Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
### Overview
This project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. Three different algorithms were implemented and compared: logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), and neural networks. The dataset used for training and testing is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass.

### Algorithms Used
##### Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification.
##### Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression challenges.
##### Neural Networks: A deep learning algorithm capable of learning complex patterns from data.
### Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set used in this project contains 569 instances with 33 features each. These features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The diagnosis indicates whether the mass is malignant or benign.
